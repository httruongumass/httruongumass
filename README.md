Hi my name is Hue Truong,
I am currently a third-year student at UMass Amherst studying computer science. 

I intend to upload interesting projects throughout my time at UMass, as well as many personal projects.

I hope to use my studies at UMass as a tool to problem solve and in turn innovate technologies in the near future

Aside from the field of computer science, my other interests are in the humanities, philosophy, finance, and music theory.
