Hello all,
I am currently a fourth-year student at UMass Amherst studying computer science. 

My intentions are to upload interesting projects throughout my time at UMass, as well as many personal projects.

I hope to use my studies at UMass as a tool to solve problems such as business inefficiencies and rendundant large-scale tasks.

Aside from the field of computer science, my other interests are in the humanities, philosophy, finance, and music theory.
