Hi my name is Hue Truong
I'm a UMass Amherst student focusing on computer science
I'll be uploading some implementations I've come up with for class
as well as some personal projects.

I hope to use my studies at UMass as a tool to problem solve and in turn innovate technologies in the near future

Aside from the field of computer science, my other interests are in the humanities, philosophy, and music theory.
