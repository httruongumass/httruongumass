Recent graduate from UMass Amherst with a B.S in Computer Science

My intentions are to upload interesting projects throughout my time at UMass, as well as many personal projects.

I hope to use my studies at UMass as a tool to solve problems such as business inefficiencies and rendundant large-scale tasks.

Aside from the field of computer science, I love guitar and golf!
